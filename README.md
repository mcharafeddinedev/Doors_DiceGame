This is for GitHub users and those that want to work within the Engine on the project. Consult with me if you have any questions, I cant answer everything but I will try -- Marwan C.

Please Read Fully

1. Files will be already sorted in Art for artists, and Programming for programmers. DO NOT add, remove, or change the default project files, or any of the Project Settings, as these can cause overwrite errors and merge conflicts.

2. Make sure you clone the repository to Github Desktop so you can work offline in case you can't work online. From there always make sure you fetch (refresh the repository), then pull when you can (bring in new files from the repository). If for whatever reason you can't, let me know on Discord.

3. Do not work outside of your folder, in order to prevent conflicts. If one person on the team pushes changes to a file that someone else has changed without having that newest version of said file, it can and will corrupt that file. This can be the tiniest change in a blueprint, so just make sure you work in stuff from your own folder, so we dont have conflicts.

4. The Unreal project is directly connected to the repository so you can refresh, push, and pull from Tools -> Revision Control. Before doing any work, go to Tools -> Revision Control -> Change Revision Control and select Accept Settings. That will make sure you are connected to the repository.

5. You can commit and push to the repository by going to Github Desktop and Commit and then Push Changes, or in the Unreal Editor by going to Tools -> Revision Control -> Submit Content. Make sure to put your name and what changes you made or files you added in the text box before you submit. DO NOT create or move any folders in the project. This is the only way your progress will be saved, so be careful!

6. After you fetch from the repository, pull only from Github Desktop, as attempting to do so from the Editor will crash the program. DO NOT delete any files when committing changes, before making sure with people in Programming that it really should be deleted.

7. DO NOT edit, add to, or remove any files in the repository that are outside the project files, including this readme.
